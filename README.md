# Building Machine Learning Models from Scratch
This repository contains the implementation of various Machine Learning models (both classification and regression) from scratch in Python without using any of the inbuilt python libraries and functions. Its a great way to build foundation models and strengthen your understanding.
This Repo contains following models code:
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Majority Vote Classifier
- Hidden Markov Models
- Simple Neural Network (MLP)
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
